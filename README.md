# Zarinpal Checkout V4

# Forked From: [Zarinpal Checkout](https://github.com/siamak/zarinpal-checkout)
* Easy to Use
* Promises/A+ Compatible
* Sandboxing

## üïπ Usage
Install the package from `npm` or `yarn` and require it in your Node project:
```bash
npm install zarinpal-checkout-v4
# or
yarn add zarinpal-checkout-v4
```

```javascript
const Zarinpal = require('zarinpal-checkout-v4');
// or
import Zarinpal from 'zarinpal-checkout-v4';
```

Then create an instance:
### Sandbox is currently unavailable on Zarinpal's side
```javascript
/**
 * Create Zarinpal
 * callbackURL and Sandbox are both optional.
 * if callbackURL is not provided here, 
 * one must be provided upon requesting payment
 */
const initParams: InitParams = {
    merchantId: 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx',
    callbackURL: 'https://your-domain/verify',
    sandbox: false,
  }
const zarinpal = Zarinpal.CreateInstance(initParams);
```
